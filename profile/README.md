**🚩 Our Current Engagement: SimCorp's Cloud Security** 🚩

**Problem Domain:**  
SimCorp, a leading financial asset management company, has entrusted us with a crucial task. Following a regrettable incident involving a misconfiguration leading to sensitive data exposure, the CTO seeks assurance about the robustness of their cloud systems.

Our mission? A one-time adversary emulation engagement. The stakes? The potential for a long-term partnership, safeguarding SimCorp's digital assets and reputation.

**Our Strategy:**  
1. **Red Team** - The offense. Our task is to identify vulnerabilities within SimCorp's systems, exploiting them to understand potential risks better.
2. **Blue Team** - The defense. Concurrently, our blue team works diligently, overseeing defensive mechanisms and enhancing threat detection capabilities.
